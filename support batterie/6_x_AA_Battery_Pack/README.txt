# Summary

<strong>What is it:</strong>

This is a battery pack / holder I made for my own personal use. It's meant for connecting 6 x AA batteries in series and fit easily into a pocket. 
Useful for devices requiring low current/amp and a voltage range of around 7.2-8.4V. Like smaller photo-/camera-LED lights typically using Sony camera batteries.

<strong>Usage</strong>:

Either use non rechargable 1.5V batteries in series (total of 9V which drops depending how much current you draw) or rechargable 1.2V batteries in series for steady delivery of around 7.2V. 
Common sense... do not ever use rechargable and non rechargable batteries together and do not mix different brands of batteries together. 

The main battery tubes are approximately the length of 3 x AA batteries while the top lid is the piece that's intended to be the "variable part" that can be fitted with connection plates/springs or small printed squares/plates with some bare wires wrapped around them.  The holes/openings in the top lid are naturally intended for the main coords leading from the battery pack and for cable ties as strain reliefs.

The bottom lid is simple/straight forward and is only meant to connect the two stacked rows of batteries together.

There are two gaps/slots between the top lid and the main tubes when assembled. You can loop a nylon strap or something in these to hang the batterypack from a belt, your DSLR or a camera stand. 

<strong>You will need atleast:</strong>

* <strong>2 x 2.5mm screws with nyloc nuts</strong> These should be long enough to go right through the lids and through the nyloc nuts and a few millimeters further (stick out slightly on the other side) to lock those lids firmly in place. 
You might be able to loop small cable ties through the holes and around the pack instead of holding it together with screws, but this won't be as reliable.

* <strong>3 x Battery connection plates</strong> Either use some from a scrapped battery driven device or design your own to fit. Use the top lid's inside indentations in the best way you can. You'll figure it out....

* <strong>2 x Connection cables of choice to solder to the battery connection-plates</strong>


* <strong>2 x Cable ties (small size</strong>)

<strong>Important</strong>:

I will not be held responsible for any kind of injury or damage caused by 3d printed battery packs/holders based on this 6 x AA Battery Pack 3d model. 

Just a reminder... 

3d printed parts are not safe for electronics. If anything, only use 3d printed parts with low voltage/low current electronics and only use these devices under supervision.  Things you make yourself does not conform to any norms or regulations what so ever. 
And, don't put any trust in flame retardant filaments either. 

Ok enough with the safety talk :-)

# How I Designed This

It's a well kept secret passed down through generations, starting at the dawn of mankind... Actually, come to think of it.... this battery pack looks a bit like a monolith.
