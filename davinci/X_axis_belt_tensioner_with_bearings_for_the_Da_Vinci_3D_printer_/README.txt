# Summary

A remix of the belt tensioner [thing:690090](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:690090) that uses 2 x MR63ZZ (3x6x2.5mm) ball bearings mounted on the stock pulley.  

It makes for a more durable setup that prevents known issues with the stock tensioner, such as squeaking noises and non round circles, that typically develop after a number of printing hours.  

With this design it's also significantly easier to insert and remove the pulley, while still keeping the exact same tension as the stock one.

# Instructions

Printed in ABS, at 0.2 layer height, 100% infill.  

It's best printed with some supports for the initial overhangs. I used Simplify3D to add some manual supports, as shown in the last picture, but it should be also doable with automatically generated support structures.  

You'll need 2 x MR63ZZ ball bearings [like these](http://www.lily-bearing.com/miniature/mr63zz.htm). I found them on a local R/C hobby store. Note that ball bearings ticker than 2.5mm won't work because the pulley won't fit in the slot on the carriage.
