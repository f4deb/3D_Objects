# Summary

The purpose of this thing is to orderly and safely route the __Hot End__ wiring harness from the back of the printer to the __Hot End__.  A secondary function is to route the filament PTEF tube from the __Extruder__ to the __Hot End__  with minimal bends while maintaining clearance with the top cover of the printer.

The __Hot End__ __Cable Chain__ bracket is directly attached to the E3D V6 Bolt On Adapter (_referenced below_) via M3 bolts or Cable Ties.  Alternately a revised __Bold On Adapter__ is available which includes the __Cable Chain Mount__ as part of the _Base_:

# Post-Printing

## Install Cable Chain

- __POWER OFF PRINTER__
- Install 3ea M3 Lock Nuts in the aft Printer Mount using M3x10 screw to align the nut and draw it into the nut wells provided.
- Install the __Hot End Bracket__ using 3ea M3x10 Screws and nuts.  Use washers under the screw head and also under the nuts.
- Assemble 15 links into a chain and snap the assembly into the __Printer__ and __Hot End__ mounts.
- Remove wiring harness from the __Hot End__ and insert it into the __Cable Chain__.
- Install 17 Retaining Clips
- Plug wiring harness into __Hot End__ Connector.
- Secure wiring harness at the __Hot End__ using a cable ties and the holes provided in the mount bracket.
- Route the Filament PTFE tube under the __Cable Chain__ as indicated in the attached photos.

# How I Designed This

## Printer Attachment

All attachment hardware is M3x10 with locking nuts.

The aft portion of the __Printer Attach Bracket__ contains M3 hex nut wells.  This eases the attachment of the bracket since it is difficult to hold the nut while turning the screws.

The __Hot End Cable Chain Bracket__ fastens to the cable tie eyelets no the E3D V6 adapter (_referenced above_) and can be modified to attach to other __Hot Ends__.
