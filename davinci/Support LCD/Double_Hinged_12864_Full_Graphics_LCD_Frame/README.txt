# Summary

This is a follow-up on my previous project [Double Hinged Smart 2004 LCD Frame](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:575766), this time for the [RepRapDiscount Full Graphics 12864 LCD Controller](http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Full_Graphic_Smart_Controller).   The LCD frame is mounted on my box frame Prusa i3 via the same sturdy double hinge mechanism, so that the display can be folded away when not it use.  

For further details, photos  and instructions regarding the spring loaded hinge mechanism please refer to the [LCD2004 version](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:575766).  There you also find the mirrored version of the hinge mechanism, in case that one fits better your specific needs.  

The fully configured SCAD file is contains the source for both the graphic LCD12864 and the non-graphic LCD2004 versions.  Ready-to-print  STL files are provided for the LCD frame and for the hinge mechanism.   

_**Update 2015-02-21:** I just uploaded an additional smaller square version of the hinge.  this might be useful for situations where only little space is available for mounting the hinge._

_**Update 2016-12-18:** User [menerso](http://www.thingiverse.com/menerso) (thank you!) noted that the small hinge was not able to rotate correctly without rasping away part of a corner of one of the pieces.  So I replaced the corresponding STL file with the corresponding version from my [TinyOLED controller](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:816376) which does not have this problem._
